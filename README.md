# Karma


Karma is a platform that helps nonprofits connect with volunteers and donors more easily and more visibly. While large organizations often have marketing reach and technical support, small community nonprofits frequently struggle to be discovered—even when people nearby are actively looking for ways to help. Karma closes that gap. By combining personalized onboarding, searchable nonprofit directories, and streamlined volunteer and donation tools, Karma makes it simple for anyone to contribute, and for nonprofits of any size to grow their impact.

## Overview

Many people—especially students—want to volunteer but don’t know where to start, while nonprofits need help but lack access to the audiences ready to support them. Karma brings both sides together in one place.

Users can:
Sign in quickly with modern authentication (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or email)
Browse nonprofits nearby or by category
Volunteer for opportunities with smart filtering and structured applications
Donate (one-time, recurring, or anonymous)
Message organizations directly
Track their progress, achievements, and community impact
Enjoy personalized recommendations based on interests, location, and activity
Nonprofits get their own streamlined experience for tracking engagement, managing supporters, and communicating clearly—without needing large infrastructure or staff.
Karma makes participation simple and impact visible.
